This insightful study explores the effects of religious involvement, sex education, and marital status on the beliefs of teens, specially measuring their access to birth control without parental consent. Utilizing the 2018 General Social Survey (GSS), we employed logistic regression models to assess the relative influence of these factors on the direct effect they have on this belief. Our robust data set included responses from 1,480 individuals offering a representative snapshot of people living in America. Analyzing three logistic regression modes, we found that those who have never been married compared to those have been married are more likely to be supportive in the use of teens using birth control, while those who are in favor for sex education to be taught in school are more likely to be supportive of the belief. Conversely, your affiliation to your religion appeared to exert no discernible impact. These results highlight the nuanced role of religious involvement and sex education in shaping this belief, underscoring crucial insights for stakeholders, particularly as these factors drive targeted social interventions. Future research should study how your marital status and the type of sex education obtained in school, can affect if a teen were to use birth control.
